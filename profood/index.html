        <p id="introparah">
            Greetings from India,<br>
            India is a great country where people speak different languages but the national
            language is Hindi. India is full of different castes, creeds, religion, and cultures but
            they live together. That's the reasons India is famous for the common saying of “unity in diversity“.
            India is the seventh-largest country in the whole world.

        <p id="content">
            India food like its culture is varied and is quite popular across the world. Indian food is the
            blend of varied herbs and spices which
            make every dish quite unique and special. Though most of the countries love Indian food,
            it is considered to be quite spicy when compared to the other cuisines.
